po
==

An attempt at making the Dragon Scroll for Vim. 

Po is a reference to the movie Kung Fu Panda, where a bumbling big fat panda finds himself in the midst of kung fu masters and finally earns himself a reputation. He finally receives the Dragon Scroll, that's supposed to hold the secret to true mastery... and the scroll turns out to be an empty reflective surface. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda )

Po is a progressive work where we begin from resetting Vim to an editor that can do nothing, and unleash features and commands one-by-one as we master the ones that came before.

Po does not go with the traditional Vim shortcuts and commands, but rather invents its own methods for doing things. This can be greately irritating for the masters of Vim Fu, but a true master must make way for inner peace and let the disciple learn.

### Is it for me?

 * You should skip this if you're comfortable with Vim already. 
 * You should disregard this if you move in hjkl.
 * You should avoid this if you have a Vim guru hovering over your shoulder.
 * If you wanted to learn Vim but found it too difficult to understand, keep reading.
 * If you learned a a little and gave up because the commands didn't feel right? Hang in there, you might find this a good starting point for your own journey to mastering editing with Vim.
 
### Installation

* Fire up your shell in MacOSX or Linux
* Backup current config if any: `mv .vimrc vimrc.backup`
* Go into Dropbox folder: `cd ~/Dropbox`
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/hiway/po.git`
* Let po take over: `cp po/vimrc ~/.vimrc`

In case you have your own setup, you really want to reconsider using 
this configuration since it changes everything and involves a _lot_ 
of unlearning - the author was hellbent on putting self through this,
if you choose this way, please do not add this on top of your 
configuration - it is made to replace the defaults.
